# composition

1.) Polymorphism means "many forms" it mainly occus when there are many classes that are related by inheritance

2.) It means we create an instance of like the 'polymorph' as another class. An example would be the ISecurity in the themepark lab, where the Playground and Rollercoaster implement it.


3.) Interfaces


4.) No limit


5.) When you want to manipulate different classes that are not related.

    For example the CodeClan stall labs, where we had to connect the stalls and the rides using IReview


6.) Composition occurs when your class *HAS* an instance of another class in its field


7.) When a particular class is in need of another class. For example A Country has a capital

8.) In agggregation, the object can still exist if the other is 'destroyed', but in composition the object cannot exist if its "Owner" is destroyed.

9.) You can get methods without having to rely on inheritance diagrams


10.) They are destroyed

11.) They still exist
